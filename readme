The project implements the following:
RGB / Grayscale histogram, grayscale transformations, applying various masks about 18 and the possibility of applying your own, merging, applying razor pixels,
histogram stretches with Min and Max values, Treshhold with Min and Max values, reduction with qi, pi, Treshhold parameters with one value, dilation, erosion, opening, 
closing, negation, compression using the Read algorithm, Huffman code and Compression with parameters, equalizing and stratching, median different sizes with the option of
overlapping pixel brim. Also operations on two images such as ADD, DIFF, SUB, OR, XOR, AND. The Aforge library is used for overlapping dilution, erosion, opening and closing.
